1. Code 1: train_alex.py (AlexNet-based Image Classification Training Code)
(1) Code Functionality
This code implements the training process of an image classification model based on the AlexNet architecture, using a custom dataset.

(2) Code Structure and Key Points
Dataset Loading

Uses a custom ImageTxtDataset class to load the dataset instead of the standard CIFAR-10 dataset.

Dataset path and format:

Image paths and labels are stored in train.txt.

Images are stored in D:\dataset\image2\train.

Data preprocessing:

transforms.Resize(224) resizes images to 224×224 to match AlexNet’s input requirements.

transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip() applies random horizontal flipping for data augmentation.

transforms.ToTensor() converts images to tensors.

transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]) normalizes images using ImageNet’s mean and std.

Model Definition

Defines a simplified AlexNet model:

5 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers.

Uses MaxPool2d for downsampling.

The final layer outputs 10 classes (for a 10-class classification task).

Input: 3-channel RGB images.

Training Process

Uses DataLoader with a batch size of 64.

Loss & Optimizer:

Cross-entropy loss (CrossEntropyLoss).

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.01 and momentum of 0.9.

Logs training loss every 500 steps and visualizes it with TensorBoard.

Evaluates the model on the test set after each epoch, computing loss and accuracy.

Saves the model as a .pth file after each epoch.

Testing Process

Uses torch.no_grad() to disable gradient computation (reduces memory usage and speeds up inference).

Computes test loss and accuracy, logging results to TensorBoard.

(3) Key Learning Points
Custom dataset usage:

Loading image paths and labels from a text file.

Preprocessing data to fit model requirements.

AlexNet architecture:

Understanding convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.

Modifying the output layer for task-specific needs.

Training & testing workflow:

Data loading, loss computation, optimizer updates, evaluation, and model saving.

Visualization with TensorBoard.

Data augmentation:

Techniques like random flipping to improve generalization.

2. Code 2: transformer.py (Vision Transformer (ViT) Implementation)
(1) Code Functionality
This code implements a Vision Transformer (ViT) model based on the Transformer architecture for processing sequential image data.

Module Definitions

FeedForward module:

Contains linear layers, GELU activation, Dropout, and LayerNorm.

Attention module:

Implements multi-head self-attention.

Uses Softmax for attention weights.

Leverages einops.rearrange and repeat for tensor reshaping.

Transformer module:

Stacks multiple Transformer layers (each with attention + feedforward).

Uses residual connections (x = attn(x) + x and x = ff(x) + x).

ViT Model:

Splits images into patches and processes them via Transformer.

Uses positional embeddings (pos_embedding) and a class token (cls_token).

Final classification via a fully connected layer.

Model Structure

Input: A sequential image (time_series) of shape (batch_size, channels, seq_len).

Splits images into patches of size patch_size.

Processes patches via Transformer.

Output: Classification logits of shape (batch_size, num_classes).

Test Code

Creates a ViT instance and feeds a random tensor (time_series).

Output logits confirm the model works correctly.

(3) Key Learning Points
Transformer architecture:

Importance of positional and class embeddings.

einops library:

Simplifies tensor operations (rearrange, repeat).

Input/Output formats:

Sequential image input → classification output.
